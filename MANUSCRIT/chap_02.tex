\section{Numerical method}\label{sec: num meth}

To solve the system of equations (\ref{eq-qmvt})-(\ref{eq-energ}) we use a finite-element method that was implemented using the open-source software FreeFem++ \citep{freefem,hecht-2012-JNM}, using a large variety of triangular finite elements  to solve partial differential equations. FreeFem++  is an integrated product with its own high level programming language and a syntax close to mathematical formulations, making the implementation of numerical algorithms very easy. Among the numerous numerical tools offered by FreeFem++, the use of the powerful mesh adaptivity function proved mandatory in this study to obtain accurate results within reasonable computational time.
The numerical code was optimized to afford the mesh refinement every time step:  the mesh density was increased around  the phase change interfaces,  offering an optimal resolution of the large gradients of all regularized functions ($S, K, C, L_F$), while  the mesh was de-refined (larger triangles) in the solid part, where a coarser mesh could be used. A simulation using a globally refined mesh would require a prohibitive computational time for an equivalent accuracy of the melting front resolution. Similar algorithms based on FreeFem++  were successfully used for solving different systems of equations with locally sharp variation of the solution, such as Gross-Pitaevskii equation \citep{dan-2010-JCP,dan-2016-CPC} or  Laplace equations with nonlinear source terms \citep{dan-2013-AMM}. 

The space discretization is based on Taylor-Hood finite elements, approximating  the velocity with $P_{2}$ Lagrange finite elements (piecewise quadratic), and the
the pressure with the $P_{1}$ finite elements (piecewise linear). The temperature and the enthalpy are discretized using $P_1$ finite elements.  
The weak formulation of (\ref{eq-qmvt})-(\ref{eq-energ}), necessary for the finite-element implementation is described in detail in \cite{dan-2014-JCP}.  There are two novelties in the present numerical approach, when compared to  \cite{dan-2014-JCP}: 
{\em (i)} we use an approach based on the Carman-Kozeny model to bring the velocity to zero inside the solid phase, as described in the previous section, instead of the  viscosity penalty method (imposing a large value of the viscosity in the solid);
{\em (ii)} we increase  the time accuracy of the algorithm by replacing the first-order Euler scheme with the second-order Gear (BDF2) scheme (see also \cite{Belhamadia2012}),
\begin{equation}	
\label{eq-Gear}
	\frac{d\phi}{dt} \simeq \frac{3\phi^{n+1} - 4\phi^{n}+ \phi^{n-1}}{2\delta t},
\end{equation}
computing the solution $\phi^{n+1}$ at time  $t_{n+1}=(n+1) \delta t$ by using two previous states ($\phi^{n}, \phi^{n-1}$). We use this scheme to advance in time both velocity ($\phi=\vec{u}$) and temperature fields  ($\phi=\theta$).  The other terms in equations (\ref{eq-qmvt})-(\ref{eq-energ}) are treated implicitly (\ie taken at time $t_{n+1}$). The resulting non-linear equations are solved using a Newton algorithm. 

\subsection{Finite element algorithm} \label{sec-FE-algo}

Finite-element methods for solving Navier-Stokes type systems of equations  are generally based on a separate discretization of the temporal derivative (using finite difference, splitting or characteristics methods) and the generalization of the Stokes problem for the resulting system \citep{Temam,GRaviart,Quarteroni}. We use the second-order implicit finite-difference discretization (\ref{eq-Gear}) of the temporal derivative and obtain the time semi-discretization of the single-domain model (\ref{eq-qmvt})-(\ref{eq-energ}):
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-time-disc1}
\nabla\cdot \vec{u}^{n+1} + {\gamma} p^{n+1} &=& 0, \\ \nonumber
\frac{3}{2} \frac{\vec{u}^{n+1}}{\delta t} +(\vec{u}^{n+1}\cdot\nabla) \vec{u}^{n+1} +\nabla p^{n+1} 
- {\frac{1}{Re} \nabla^2 \vec u^{n+1}}  & & \\ \nonumber 
- A(\theta^{n+1})\vec u^{n+1}- f_B(\theta^{n+1}) \, \vec{e}_y &=&  \\
2 \frac{\vec{u}^{n}}{\delta t}-\frac{\vec{u}^{n-1}}{2\delta t},\\ \nonumber
\frac{3}{2} \frac{\theta^{n+1} + S(\theta^{n+1})}{\delta t} +
\nabla\cdot\left(\vec{u}^{n+1} \theta^{n+1}\right)
- \nabla \cdot\left( \frac{K}{RePr} \nabla \theta^{n+1} \right) &=& \\ \label{eq-time-disc3}
2\frac{ \theta^{n} + S(\theta^{n})}{\delta t}-\frac{ \theta^{n-1} + S(\theta^{n-1}) }{2\delta t}.
\end{eqnarray}
This system of non-linear equations is solved at time  $t_{n+1}=(n+1) \delta t$, using two  previous states at $t_{n}$ and $t_{n-1}$.  We denoted by $f_B(\theta)$ the Boussinesq force that can be non-linear in the general case (\eg natural convection or freezing of water). The penalty parameter $\gamma$ 
takes very low values ($\gamma=10^{-7}$)  to ensure a pressure field with zero average and, at the algebraic level, fulfil the diagonal of the pressure term.  


The space discretization of variables over the domain $\Omega=[0,1]^2$ use a finite-element method based on a weak formulation of the system (\ref{eq-time-disc1})-(\ref{eq-time-disc3}). 
We consider homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity, \ie $\vec{u}=0$ on $\pl \Omega$, and set the classical Hilbert spaces for the velocity and pressure:
\begin{equation}
\vec{V}=V\times V, \, V=H^1_0(\Omega), \quad Q=\left\{q\in L^2(\Omega)\left|\; \int_{\Omega}q=0\right.\right\}
\end{equation}
Following the generalization of the Stokes problem \citep{Temam,GRaviart,Quarteroni}, the variational formulation of the system  (\ref{eq-time-disc1})-(\ref{eq-time-disc3}) can be written as: find $(\vec{u}^{n+1}, p^{n+1}, \theta^{n+1}) \in \vec{V}\times Q\times V$, such that:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq-weak-all}
b\left(\vec{u}^{n+1}, q\right) - \gamma (p^{n+1},q)&=& \\ \nonumber
0, \, \forall \, q \in Q \\ \nonumber
\frac{3}{2 \delta t} \left(\vec{u}^{n+1},\vec{v}\right) + c\left(\vec{u}^{n+1} ; \vec{u}^{n+1}, \vec{v} \right) +
{a\left(\vec{u}^{n+1}, \vec{v}\right)} & &\\ \nonumber
- (A(\theta^{n+1}) \, \vec u^{n+1},\vec v)+ b\left(\vec{v}, p^{n+1}\right)
- {\left(f_B(\theta^{n+1}) \, \vec{e}_y,\vec{v}\right)}
&=& \\ \nonumber
\frac{2}{\delta t} \left(\vec{u}^{n},\vec{v}\right) 
- \frac{1}{2 \delta t} \left(\vec{u}^{n-1},\vec{v}\right), \, \forall \, \vec{v} \in \vec{V}\\  \nonumber
\frac{3}{2 \delta t} \left(\theta^{n+1} + S(\theta^{n+1}), \phi\right)
+\left(\vec{u}^{n+1} \cdot \nabla \theta^{n+1} , \phi
\right) +
\left( \frac{K}{Re Pr} \nabla \theta^{n+1}, \nabla \phi \right) &=& \\  \nonumber
\frac{2}{\delta t} \left( \theta^{n}+S(\theta^n), \phi\right)
- \frac{1}{2 \delta t} \left( \theta^{n-1}+S(\theta^{n-1}), \phi\right),\, \forall \, \phi \in V,
\end{eqnarray}
where {$(u , v)=\int_{\Omega} u\cdot v$} denotes the scalar product in $L^2(\Omega)$ or $\left(L^2(\Omega)\right)^2$; the bilinear forms $a, b$ and trilinear form $c$ are defined as \cite{GRaviart,Quarteroni}:
\begingroup \small{
	\begin{eqnarray*}\nonumber
		a: \vec{V} \times \vec{V} \rightarrow \R, & & {a(\vec{u},\vec{v})= \int_{\Omega}  
			 \vec{D}(\vec{u}) : \vec{D}(\vec{v}) = \int_{\Omega}   \sum_{i,j=1}^2{D}_{ij}(\vec{u}) {D}_{ij}(\vec{v})},\\ 
		b: \vec{V} \times Q \rightarrow \R, & & b(\vec{u},q) = -\int_{\Omega}\nabla \cdot\vec{u}\, q =
		-\sum_{i=1}^2\int_{\Omega}\pl_i u_i\cdot q, \\ \nonumber
		c: \vec{V} \times \vec{V} \times \vec{V} \rightarrow \R, & & c(\vec{w}; \vec{z}, \vec{v})=\int_{\Omega} \left[\left(\vec{w} \cdot \nabla\right) \vec{z}\right] \cdot\vec{v}
		=\sum_{i,j=1}^2\int_{\Omega} w_j (\pl_j z_i) v_i,
		\label{eq-biforms}
	\end{eqnarray*}
}
$\vec D(\vec u) = (1/2)\left( \nabla \vec u + \nabla \vec u^T \right)$ is the rate of strain symmetric tensor with components
$D_{ij}(\vec u) = (1/2) \left( \partial u_i/ \partial x_j + \partial u_j/ \partial x_i \right) $.

The system of non-linear equations (\ref{eq-weak-all}) is solved using a Newton method. To advance the solution from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$, we start from an initial guess $w_0 = (\vec{u}^{n}, p^{n}, \theta^{n})$ (which is the solution at $t_n$), and construct the Newton sequence $w_k = (u_k, p_k, \theta_k)$ by solving for each inner iteration $k$:
\begingroup \small{
	\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-newton-C1}
	b\left(\vec{u}_{k+1}, q\right) - \gamma (p_{k+1},q) &=& 0, \\ \nonumber
	\frac{3}{2 \delta t} \left(\vec{u}_{k+1},\vec{v}\right)
	+ c\left(\vec{u}_{k+1} ; \vec{u}_{k}, \vec{v} \right)
	&+& c\left(\vec{u}_{k} ; \vec{u}_{k+1}, \vec{v} \right)\\ \nonumber
	+ 
	a\left( \vec{u}_{k+1}, \vec{v}\right)

	&-& \left(A(\theta_k) \, \vec{u}_{k+1}, \vec{v}\right) + b\left(\vec{v}, p_{k+1}\right)  \\ \nonumber
	- {\left(\frac{df_B}{d\theta}(\theta_k)\, \theta_{k+1} \, \vec{e}_y, \vec{v}\right)} &=&  
	\frac{1}{\delta t} \left( 2 \vec{u}^n - \frac{1}{2} \vec{u}^{n-1},\vec{v}\right) \\ \nonumber
	+ c\left(\vec{u}_k ; \vec{u}_{k}, \vec{v} \right) 
	&-& \left(\frac{d A}{d\theta}(\theta_k)\, \theta_{k} \, \vec{u}_k, \vec{v}\right), \,\,\, \\  \nonumber
	\frac{3}{2\delta t} \left(\theta_{k+1} + \frac{dS}{d\theta}(\theta_k)\, \theta_{k+1}, \phi\right)
	+\left(\vec{u}_{k} \cdot \nabla \theta_{k+1} , \phi  \right)
	&+& \left( \vec{u}_{k+1} \cdot \nabla  \theta_k , \phi \right) \\ \nonumber
	+ \left( \frac{K}{Re Pr} \nabla \theta_{k+1}, \nabla \phi \right)

	\frac{2}{\delta t} \left(\theta^n + S(\theta^n) , \phi\right)  \\ \nonumber
	+\left(\vec{u}_{k} \cdot \nabla  \theta_k, \phi \right)
	+ \frac{3}{2 \delta t} \left(\frac{dS}{d\theta}(\theta_k)\, \theta_{k}  - S(\theta^n) ,\, \phi\right) 
	&-& \frac{1}{2 \delta t} \left(\theta^{n-1} + S(\theta^{n-1}),\, \phi\right).\,\,\,
	\end{eqnarray}
} \endgroup
We underline the fact that the Newton loop (following $k$) has to be iterated until convergence for each time step $\delta t$ following the algorithm:

\begin{equation} \label{eq-Newton-algo}
\begin{tabular}{||ll}
\multicolumn{2}{||l}{Navier-Stokes time loop following $n$}\\
\multicolumn{2}{||l}{set  $w_0=(\vec{u}^{n}, p^{n}, \theta^{n})$}\\
& \begin{tabular}[t]{||ll}
\multicolumn{2}{||l}{Newton iterations  following $k$}\\
&solve (\ref{eq-newton-C1}) to get $ \vec w_{k+1} $\\
\multicolumn{2}{||l}{stop when  $\| \vec w_{k+1} - \vec w_k \| < \xi_N$}
\end{tabular}\\
\multicolumn{2}{||l}{actualize $(\vec{u}^{n+1}, p^{n+1}, \theta^{n+1}) = w_{k+1}$}
\end{tabular}
\end{equation}
It is interesting to note that the previous system of equations depends only on $\vec{u}^n$, $\vec{u}^{n-1}$, $\theta^n$ and $\theta^{n-1}$ and is independent of $p^n$, the pressure being in this approach a Lagrange multiplier for the divergence free constraint. 

\subsection{Characteristics method for the convective terms}

An alternative for the treatment of non-linear terms in the momentum equation is offered by the characteristics Galerkin method \cite{Pironneau92}. Defining the characteristic flow (passing at time $t$ through the point $\vec{x}$)
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}\vspace{0.2cm}
\ds\frac{\partial \vec{X} }{\partial \tau}(\tau, t, \vec{x})=\vec{u} (\tau,\vec{X} (\tau,t, \vec{x})), \quad \tau\in (0,t_{max})\\
\vec{X} (t, t, \vec{x}) = \vec{x},
\end{array}
\right.
\label{eq-charactD}
\end{equation}
one can express the substantial (total) derivative of any function $\Phi(t,\vec{x})$ as
\begin{equation}
\frac{D\Phi}{Dt}(t,\vec{x})=\left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial
	t}+\vec{u}\cdot\nabla \Phi \right)(t,\vec{x})=\frac{\partial}{\partial
	t}\left(\Phi(\tau, \vec{X}(\tau,t, \vec{x}))\right)|_{\tau=t},
\end{equation}
and finally use the time discretization:
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{D\Phi}{Dt}\right)^{n+1}(\vec{x})\approx\frac{\Phi^{n+1}(\vec{x})-\Phi^{n}\circ \vec{X}^n(\vec{x})}{\delta t},
\end{equation}
with $\vec{X}^n(\vec{x})$ a suitable approximation of $\vec{X}(t_n,t_{n+1},\vec{x})$, obtained by an integration back in time of (\ref{eq-charact}) from $t_{n+1}$ to $t_n$ for each grid point $\vec{x}$. The Galerkin characteristic method is implemented in Freefem++ as an operator computing $\Phi \circ \vec{X}^n$ for given mesh, convection velocity field and time step.

The weak formulation  (\ref{eq-weak-all}) becomes after using the characteristics method:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq-charact}
b\left(\vec{u}^{n+1}, q\right) - \gamma (p^{n+1},q)&=& \\ \nonumber
0, \, \forall \, q \in Q \\ \nonumber
\frac{3}{2 \delta t} \left(\vec{u}^{n+1},\vec{v}\right) +
a\left(\vec{u}^{n+1}, \vec{v}\right) 
+ b\left(\vec{v}, p^{n+1}\right) 
- f_B(\theta^{n+1}) \left(\vec{e}_y,\vec{v}\right)
&=& \\ \nonumber
\frac{2}{\delta t} \left(\vec{u}^{n}\circ \vec{X}^n,\vec{v}\right) - \frac{1}{2 \delta t} \left(\vec{u}^{n-1}\circ \vec{X}^{n-1},\vec{v}\right), \, \forall \, \vec{v} \in \vec{V}\\  \nonumber
\frac{3}{2 \delta t} \left(\theta^{n+1}, \phi\right)  
+
\left( \frac{K}{\Prd} \nabla \theta^{n+1}, \nabla \phi \right) &=& \\ \nonumber
 \frac{2}{\delta t} \left(\theta^{n}\circ \vec{X}^n, \phi\right) -  \frac{1}{2 \delta t} \left(\theta^{n-1}\circ \vec{X}^{n-1}, \phi\right), \, \forall \, \phi \in V,
\end{eqnarray}
The system (\ref{eq-charact}) is then solved to advance the solution from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$ in one step. The drawback of the method is that it requires small time steps for accurately computing of the convection terms. 

 \subsection{Mesh adaptivity} \label{subs:FEadapt}

Mesh adaptivity by metric control is a standard function offered by FreeFem++ \citep{hecht-2012-JNM}. The key idea for the mesh adaptivity (see also \cite{hecht-2000-ijnmf,hecht-1997-aiaa,george-1998}) is to modify the scalar product used in an automatic mesh generator to evaluate distance and volume, in order to  construct equilateral elements according to a new adequate metric.  The scalar
product is based on the evaluation of the Hessian $\mathcal{H}$ of the variables of the problem. Indeed, for a $P_1$ discretization of a
variable $\chi$, the interpolation error is bounded by:
\begin{equation}
{\cal E } = |\chi - \Pi_h \chi |_0 \leq c \sup_{T\in \mathcal{T}_{h}} \sup_{x,y,z\in T}   |\mathcal{H}(x)|(y-z , y-z)
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where $\Pi_h \chi $ is the $P_1$ interpolate  of $\chi$, $ |\mathcal{H}(x)|$ is the  Hessian of $\chi$ at point $x$ after being made positive definite.
We can infer that, if we generate, using  a Delaunay procedure (e.g. \cite{george-1998}), a  mesh with edges close to the unit length  in the metric  $\mathcal{M} ={|\mathcal{H}| \over (c {\cal{E}})}$, the interpolation error ${\cal E}$ will be equally distributed over the edges $a_i$ of the mesh. More precisely, we have
\begin{equation}
{1 \over c {\cal E}} a_i^T {\cal M } a_i \le 1.
\end{equation}

The previous approach could be generalized for a vector variable $\chi=[\chi_1, \chi_2]$.
After computing the metrics $\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{2}$ for each variable, we define a metric intersection  $\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{M}_{1} \cap \mathcal{M}_{2}$,
such that the unit ball of $\mathcal{M}$ is included in  the intersection of the two  unit balls  of metrics $\mathcal{M}_{2}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{1}$ (for details, see the  procedure defined in \cite{frey-george-1999}). 

For the cases considered in this study, we used five metrics intersection to adapt the mesh, based on $S^{n+1}, S^{n}, T^{n+1}, T^{n}, \vec{u}^{n+1}$. To reduce the impact of the interpolation on the global accuracy for time-depending problems, we consider the metrics computed from actual (at $t_{n+1}$) and  previous (at $t_{n}$) values, for the same variable used for adaptivity (see also \cite{Belhamadia2004_S}).
The anisotropy of the mesh is a parameter of the algorithm and it was set to values close to 1. This is an inevitable limitation since we also impose the minimum edge-length of triangles to avoid generating too large number of nodes.

Some examples of the adapted mesh generated during the computation of the solidification phase are given in section \ref{sec-solidification}.
The method is able to accurately capture the liquid-solid interface during the melting process and the two solidification fronts appearing during the solidification of the PCM. 
Mesh adaptivity is performed at each time step and offers a refined discretization of the regularization region where sharp gradients have to be accurately captured.  The number of triangles for the melting case is $N_t=12,000$ and $N_t=17,000$ for the solidification phase. Non-adapted grids offering the same spatial resolution everywhere inside the computational domain would have resulted for the two cases in $N_t=9.94 \cdot 10^{10}$ and $N_t=10 \cdot 10^{10}$ triangles, respectively. Consequently, mesh adaptivity greatly helps in reducing the computational time.

\subsection{Accuracy and convergence} \label{subsec-conv}
We test the accuracy of our numerical method in this section.
Both space and time convergence orders are demonstrated by using the Burggraf flow and a manufactured solution defined by \cite{nourgaliev2016fully} for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
The global error $ \| \varepsilon_h \|$ is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \| \varepsilon_h \| = \| \Phi_e - \phi_h \|,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_e$ is the exact solution and $\phi_h$ is the numerical solution.
Thus, by computing $\| \varepsilon_h \|$ for either different grids or different time steps, one can evaluate the convergence order $p$, since it is represented by the slope of the corresponding curve in logarithmic coordinates.

Computations are done for the convection of air, with a Rayleigh number $Ra = 10^6$ and a Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$.

\subsubsection{Burggraf flow} \label{subsub-conv-burg}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.98\textwidth]{Fig_cap_2/Convergence_BURGGRAF} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{Burggraf flow. Evolution of the global error $\| \varepsilon_h \|$ for both $\mathcal{L}_2$-norm and $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-norm, with different grid size. A Taylor-Hood finite element (P$_2$ for velocity and P$_1$ for pressure) is used for space discretization by taking either P$_1$ finite element (a) or P$_2$ finite element (b) for the temperature field.}
	\label{fig-conv-burggraf}
\end{figure}

To demonstrate the space accuracy of our method, we compute the well-known analytical solution called the Burggraf flow.
It consists of a steady recirculating flow in a square cavity $[ 0 , 1] \times [ 0 , 1]$, with a moving wall at the top boundary and non-slip wall conditions at the others :

\begin{eqnarray}
   u(x,0) &=& u(0,y) = u(1,y) = 0, \\
   u(x,1) &=& \sigma (x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2).
\end{eqnarray}
Besides, constant temperatures are imposed at the top and the bottom walls, while others are assumed to be adiabatic.
The exact solution of the flow is:
\begin{eqnarray}
   u1(x,y) &=& \sigma g'(x) h'(y), \\\nonumber
   u2(x,y) &=& - \sigma g''(x) h(y), \\\nonumber
   p(x,y)   &=& \frac{\sigma}{Re} \left( h^{(3)}(y) g(x) + g''(x)h'(y) \right) + \frac{\sigma}{2} g'(x)^2 \left( h(y)h''(y)-h'(y)^2 \right),\\ \nonumber
   T(x,y) &=& T_{c} + (T_{h} - T_{c}) y + a(x) b(y), \\ \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
with,
\begin{eqnarray}
   g(x) &=& \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^4}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3}, \\ \nonumber
   h(y) &=& y^4 - y^2, \\ \nonumber
   a(x) &=& \cos (\pi x), \\ \nonumber
   b(x) &=& y(1-y).
\end{eqnarray}
Hence, forcing term are defined as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
   f_{u1} &=& 0 \\ \nonumber
   f_{u2} &=& \sigma^2 h(y) h'(y) \left( g''(x)^2 - g'(x)g^{(3)}(x) \right) \\ \nonumber
   &+& \frac{\sigma}{Re}\left( g^{(4)}(x) h(y) + 2 g''(x)h''(y) + g(x) h^{(4)}(y) \right) \\ \nonumber
   &+& \frac{\sigma^2}{2} g'(x)^2 \left( h(y) h^{(3)}(y) - h'(y)h''(y) \right) - \frac{Ra}{Pr Re^2} T(x,y),\\ \nonumber
   f_T &=& u1(x,y) a'(x) b(y) + u2(x,y) \left( T_h - T_c + a(x) b'(y) \right) \\ \nonumber
   &-& \frac{K}{Re Pr} \left( a''(x)b(y) + a(x) b''(y) \right).
\end{eqnarray}
We use the Taylor-Hood finite element (P$_2$ for velocity and P$_1$ for pressure) for the space discretization with either P$_1$ or P$_2$ finite element for the temperature field.
Figure \ref{fig-conv-burggraf} plots the decrease of the global discretization error $\| \varepsilon_h \|$ for both $\mathcal{L}_2$-norm and $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-norm function of the grid size.
The expected second order convergence is obtained with a P$_1$ finite element for the temperature (Figure \ref{fig-conv-burggraf}a), and even a nearly third order is noticed with a P$_2$ finite element on the temperature (Figure \ref{fig-conv-burggraf}b).

Since the space convergence rate was evaluated in \S \ref{subsub-conv-burg}, we fixe the grid size to $dx = 0.01$ to ensure a small spatial discretization errors, and we vary decreasingly the time step.
Time convergence is displayed in Figure \ref{fig-conv-bdf2}. 
The evolution of the global error with different time steps is plotted for both  $\mathcal{L}_2$-norm (red line) and $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-norm (green line), and the expected second order convergence is exposed for both P$_1$ (Figure \ref{fig-conv-bdf2}a) and P$_2$ (Figure \ref{fig-conv-bdf2}b) finite element for the temperature.
