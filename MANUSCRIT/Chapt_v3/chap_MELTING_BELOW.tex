We have performed extensive validation of our numerical method in Chapters \ref{chap-NATCONV} and \ref{chap-MELTING}.
Very good agreement were noticed for each validation cases against well-known benchmarks and the robustness of the algorithm was proven by simulating complex configurations.
We now use the code as an investigation tool to analyse the phase-change process during the melting stage.
We consider a square cavity of height $H$ filled with n-octadecane and pay a closer attention to the temporal evolution of different physical parameter of the system. 

Two classes of convective melting systems are of interest in this chapter: melting induced by either lateral or basal heating.
The dynamic of the melting is actually known to be fundamentally different for each of the two cases.
The shape of the interface and the streamlines in the fully developed convective flow are illustrated in panels (b) and (d) of Fig. \ref{fig:melt-scheme} for both cases.

The melting of PCM heated from the side could be representative of buildings applications, at the example of the melting of a brick of PCM we simulated in Sec \ref{sec: melting-2D}. of Chap. \ref{chap-MELTING},
in which a transparent brick of PCM is used as smart material to control the indoor environment of a building.
\cite{barreneche2016situ} have actually shown that wall made of PCMs allows to reduce the temperature peak about $20 \%$.
Bricks made of PCM melt from temperature difference between outdoor and indoor and store the energy in the form of latent heat.
Other applications such as solar collectors or other thermal energy storages are also typical of such configurations.
In any cases, accurate assessment of the heat transfer is always essential.
Analytical investigation of \cite{bejan1989analysis} and scaling analysis of \cite{jany1988scaling} have permitted to describe the heat transfer during the melting by the mean of $N\!u$-$\Ray$ correlation.

The second class refers to passive temperature control for electronic devices or for geophysical problems such as lava lakes \citep{davaille1993thermal}, thermal convection in magma chambers \citep{brandeis1989convective} or ice-melt lakes \citep{polashenski2012mechanisms}. Ice-melt ponds that form during summer season in the Arctic \citep{polashenski2012mechanisms,esfahani2018basal} are known for example to display natural convection coupled to a phase-change process on the bottom side. In that case, Rayleigh-Bénard like convection cells are observed in the liquid phase.
Experimental \citep{hale1980solid,diaz1984visualization} and numerical \citep{esfahani2018basal,madruga2018dynamic,favier2019rayleigh} analysis of the dynamic of melting could be find in the literature.
Notwithstanding linear and weakly non-linear instability analysis based on a vanishingly small Stefan number assumption \citep{vasil2011dynamic}, no purely theoretical description of the heat transfer was investigated.
Some comparisons with theories \citep{malkus1954heat,grossmann2000scaling} made in the frame of Rayleigh-Bénard convection flow have been however carried out \citep{esfahani2018basal,madruga2018dynamic,favier2019rayleigh}.

Numerical comparison of the melting of n-octadecane with either lateral or basal heating is investigated in this chapter.
Mainly a comparison of the heat transfer involving in each case is of major interest.
Analysis of the time evolution of the lateral melting process followed by a scale analysis is presented first in Sec. \ref{sec-melting-lateral}.
The numerical results for the basal melting are given in Sec. \ref{sec-melting-basal}.

\section{Lateral melting of n-octadecane PCM}  \label{sec-melting-lateral}
We consider the physical properties of n-octadecane given in Tab. \ref{tab-param-PCM} and investigate different height $H$ of the cavity and different value of $\delta T$ to assess the influence of the $\Ray$ number.
The numerical configuration is sketched in Fig. \ref{fig:melt-scheme}a.
$\Ray$ numbers ranging from $3.27 \cdot 10^5$ to $6.54 \cdot 10^6$ are investigated.
We note that for the range $\Ray$ and $\Ste$ numbers considered, the assumption of $(\beta \times \delta T) \ll 0.01$ is verified.

\noindent A second dimensionless time $\tau$ related to the analytical correlation of \cite{jany1988scaling} is introduced:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-adim-tau}
\tau = \Ste\cdot Fo = \Ste\cdot \frac{\alpha t_{\varphi}}{H^2}  = \Ste\cdot \frac{t}{Pr},
\end{equation}
where $Fo$ is the Fourier number. 

\subsection{Analysis of the time evolution of the melting process} \label{subsec-time-evol-lat}

We start by describing the time evolution of the melting process for the lower value of the $\Ste$ number.
We are interested in a slowly melting of the PCM to capture the transitions between the regimes described by \cite{jany1988scaling}, mainly the onset of the convective regime.

\noindent At $\tau=0$, the material is solid and the initial temperature is set to $\theta_0=-0.01$ everywhere inside the cavity. 
Then, the temperature of the left wall is suddenly increased to $\theta_h=1$, while the right wall is maintained at the same cold temperature $\theta_c=-0.01$. 
The material starts to melt, with a melting front (identified by the iso-line $\theta=\theta_f=0$) propagating from the left to the right side of the domain. 
%The shape of the interface and the streamlines of the flow developing in the liquid phase when the convective flow is fully developped at $\tau = 0.06$ are illustrated in Fig. (\ref{fig:melt-scheme}b).
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}

	\caption{Temperature iso-lines and streamlines in the fluid phase. The solid part is represented in blue and corresponds to the region of temperature $\theta \leq \theta_f=0$. Time instants (panels  a to f): $\tau=0.004; 0.016; 0.032; 0.063; 0.08; 0.2$. $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$, $\Pr = 56.2$ and $\Ste = 0.045$.
		}\label{fig:melt-field}
\end{figure}

\noindent Snapshots of the time evolution of the phase-change system are given in Fig. \ref{fig:melt-field} for representative time instants.
Panels (a) to (f) offer the streamline showing the clockwise recirculation of the fluid, the melting front, and the temperature distribution (the solid phase is denoted by the blue region) for a comprehensive description of the evolution of the system. 
We can easily identify three different regimes describing the time evolution of the melting process. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item From $\tau=0$ to $\tau =0.004$ (Fig.  \ref{fig:melt-field}a), we note the vertical shape of the melting front, well predicted by the classical conduction model of \cite{stefan1891theorie}. This indicates that, at this stage, heat transfer is dominated solely by conduction.
	
	 \item Between $\tau =0.016$ to $\tau =0.032$ (Fig.  \ref{fig:melt-field}b), the natural convection in the fluid phase starts to alter the shape of the melting front.
	A mixed conduction and convection regimes rule the heat transfer. 	Convection mainly affects the upper part of the fluid motion, while conduction is still dominating in the lower part. As the volume thermal expansion coefficient $\beta$ is positive, we expect a clockwise circulation of the liquid inside the convection cell, as noted by \cite{jany1988scaling}.
	This also makes the liquid-solid interface to move faster at the top of the cavity, explaining the deformed shape of the melting front, which is a signature of the convection effects  (see also \cite{kowalewski2004phase}). 
	
	\item After $\tau=0.032$ (Fig.  \ref{fig:melt-field}c-d), natural convection dominates the heat transfer process and impacts radically the solid-liquid interface shape and motion.
	The melting front line exhibits four distinct regions characterized by different slopes with respect to the vertical axis. The largest slope is observed at the top of the cavity and is related to the particular shape of the convection cell. Note that top and bottom parts of the interface are normal to the cavity boundaries because of the imposed adiabatic boundary conditions.

	\item After $\tau =0.08$  the melting front is nearly touching the right wall of the cavity, firstly at the top (Fig.  \ref{fig:melt-field}e) of the cavity. The melting process continues and the fluid progressively fills the cavity, with a melting front  deforming to a vertical line. The  simulation of the melting process is stopped at $\tau =0.2$ (Fig.  \ref{fig:melt-field}f), when it is numerically difficult to separate the melting front from the right wall boundary. At this time instant,  the fluid fraction reaches the value of $0.95$ and  the melting of the PCM is considered to be complete, even though a small region of solid PCM remains at the lower right bottom of the cavity. Note from Fig.  \ref{fig:melt-field}f the existence in the fluid  of two recirculating zones instead of a single one observed during previous stages.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scale analysis of the melting} \label{sec:scaling anal}

We further analyse each of the three regimes cited previously and identify the proper scales of the phenomenon.
The following analysis is similar to that outlined in Sec. (\ref{sec-bound-scal-anal}) for natural convection problem without phase-change.
The location of the interface will be denoted by $\Gamma_i$.
At the solid-liquid interface, the energy balance condition which takes into account the released latent heat and the discontinuity of heat flux between the solid and the liquid can be handle by the following Stefan condition:
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:Ste-condition}
%	\left. T\right|_{x=\Gamma_i} &=& T_f, \\ \nonumber
%	\rho h_{sl} \frac{\partial \Gamma_i}{\partial n} &=& - k \frac{\partial T}{\partial n},
%\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:Ste-condition}
	\left. \theta \right|_{x=\Gamma_i} &=& \theta_f =  0, \\ \nonumber
	\frac{\partial \Gamma_i}{\partial n} &=& - \frac{\Ste}{\Prd} \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial n},
\end{eqnarray}

Immediately after $t=0$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:melt-field}a), the melted PCM occupy a thin enclosure of height $H$ and width $\Gamma_i$, with $\Gamma_i \ll H$ (and thus $\partial^2 \theta/\partial y^2 \ll \partial^2 \theta/\partial x^2$).
In such configuration, the temperature varies linearly between the two sidewalls and the heat transfer is essentially ruled by conduction. 
The fluid phase is motionless and the horizontal heat flux across the incipient melting PCM is balanced by the enthalpy absorbed at the interface.
Accordingly, the interface remain vertical during this stage.

Since the velocity in the liquid phase is relatively small during this conductive regime, the momentum, the energy equations and the Stefan condition at the interface could be rewritten as follows in the small enclosure containing the melted PCM:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-balance-momentum}
   \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} &=& \frac{\Ray}{\Rey^2 \Pr} \theta, \\ \label{eq-energy-x}
    \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} &=&  \frac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial x^2}, \\ \label{eq-stefan-x}
   \frac{\partial \Gamma_i}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{\Ste}{\Prd} \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}.
\end{eqnarray}
The temperature field during the conduction regime is quasi-steady, thus linear Eq. \ref{eq-stefan-x} could be approximated by
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \Gamma_i}{\partial t} \approx - \frac{\Ste}{\Prd} \frac{\theta_f - \theta_h}{\Gamma_i} \approx  \frac{\Ste}{\Prd} \frac{1}{\Gamma_i}.
\end{equation}
The location $\Gamma_i$ of the interface is consequently given by
\begin{equation}
   \Gamma_i = \sqrt{2 \times \frac{\Ste}{\Prd} t} = \sqrt{2 \tau}.
\end{equation}
Moreover, the Nusselt number can be evaluated using the same assumption,
\begin{equation}
   N\!u= \int_0^{1} \left. \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} \right|_{x=0} dy \approx \frac{1}{\Gamma_i} \approx ({2 \tau})^{-1/2}.
\end{equation}
To summarize, during the first stage of the melting, when the heat transfer is led by conduction, the time evolution of the liquid fraction (given by the location of the interface) and the Nusselt number could be approximated by
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-Nu-Lf-Corr-Lat}
	L_f &\sim& \tau^{1/2}, \\ 
	N\!u &\sim& \tau^{-1/2}.
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{\figpath/Fig_cap_melting_basal/MELT_Regime_evol}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Illustration of the mixed regime. Solid red line is the solid-liquid interface, $\Gamma_i$ represents the location of the interface and $y^*$ denote the height of fluid impacted by the emerging convective flow.}\label{fig:melt-scheme-regime}
\end{figure}


While the melting continues to expand to the right side of the domain, a natural convection flow emerges from the top of the cavity (see Fig. \ref{fig:melt-scheme-regime}).
Convection and conduction coexist at this stage. 
The total heat transfer rate is the sum of the conductive and the convective heat transfer.
Turning back to the energy Eq. \ref{eq-energ}, a competition among three distinct effects could be identified:
\begin{equation}
	\underbrace{\frac{\Delta \theta}{t}}_{Inertia} \quad \underbrace{v \frac{\Delta \theta}{H}}_{Convection} \quad \underbrace{\alpha \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Gamma_i^2}}_{Conduction},
\end{equation}
As $t$ increases, the inertia decreases in importance, the convection effect increases since it is proportional to $v$, and the conduction becomes more and more negligible since $\Gamma_i$ is increasing with time. 

\noindent To assess for the convective heat transfer contribution during this mixed regime,
one can define a Rayleigh number based on $y^*$ as $\Ray_{y^*} = \Ray \times y^{*3}$,
with $y^{*}$ the height of the liquid zone altered by the convection flow as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:melt-scheme-regime}.
We note that at the bottom part of the cavity, the interface remains vertical by the effect of the conductive heat transfer.
Since $\Pr \gg 1$, the scaling presented in Eq. \ref{eq-scale-nbd-high-Pr} allows to evaluate the thermal boundary layer in the top region as:
 \begin{equation} \label{eq-conv-cond-reg}
 \delta_{\theta}^* \sim y^* \times \Ray_{y^*} ^{-1/4}.
\end{equation}
A this stage, the thickness $\delta_{\theta}^*$ of the thermal boundary layer is proportional to the thickness $\Gamma_i$ ($\sim \tau^{1/2}$) resulting that:
 \begin{equation}
	 y^* \sim (2 \tau)^2 \times \Ray \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{y^*}{\Gamma_i} \sim (2 \tau)^{3/2} \times \Ray.
 \end{equation}
The Nusselt number during the mixed convection-convection regime can therefore be approximated by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-Nu-conv-cond}
   N\!u \sim (2 \tau)^{-1/2} + (2 \tau)^{3/2} \times \Ray.
\end{equation}
Eq. \ref{eq-Nu-conv-cond} indicates that the contribution of the conduction $\left( 1/\sqrt{2 \tau}\right)$ decreases with time while the convection one is increasing.
%From a simple analysis of $\partial N\!u/\partial \theta = 0$, one can find the minimum value of the Nusselt number $N\!u_{min} \sim Ra^{1/4}$ occurring at $\tau \sim \Ray^{-1/2}$.

Finally, when the natural convection flow is fully developed and dominates the heat transfer along the vertical heated wall, the thermal boundary layer is $\delta_{\theta} \sim \Ray^{1/4}$ and therefore the Nusselt number scale is:
\begin{equation}
   N\!u \sim \Ray^{1/4}
\end{equation}

\cite{Okada1984} have suggested from his experimental data the following correlation of $N\!u$ taking into account the foregoing presented regimes:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-corr-Okada}
	N\!u = \left \{
	      %\begin{array}{ll}
	      \begin{aligned}
	      		\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \tau}} \quad  &\text{if} \quad \tau \leq \tau_t, \\ 
	      		\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \tau_t}} \left \{ 1 + C (\tau - \tau_t) \right \} \quad & \text{if} \quad \tau > \tau_t, \\
			c_1 \Ray^{0.266} \quad & \text{otherwise},
	       %\end{array}  
	       \end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}
with $c_1 = 0.234$ a constant fitted from the experimental data, $\tau_t$ the transition time from conduction to convection as discussed previously.

\noindent \cite{jany1988scaling} have proposed the following single correlation, also combining the regimes described previously:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-Nu-scale}
N\!u(\tau) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \tau}} + \left[c_1 \Ray^{1/4} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \tau}} \right]  \left[ 1 + \left(c_2 \Ray^{3/4}  \tau^{3/2}\right)^n \right]^{1/n}.
\end{equation}
The values of the constants were fitted from numerical data: $c_1 = 0.27$, $c_2 = 0.0275$, and $n=-2$. 

\noindent Both of Eqs. \ref{eq-corr-Okada} and \ref{eq-Nu-scale} are compared with our numerical results in Fig. \ref{fig:Nusselt} showing the time evolution of the Nusselt number at the left wall.
Our results perfectly fit with the theoretical prediction of \cite{jany1988scaling} and are also in good agreement with the correlation of \cite{Okada1984}. 
The gap between the current simulation and the results of \cite{Okada1984} could be explained by the experimental heat loss mentioned by the author and the uncertainties of the experimental measurements.
The regimes described by the shape of the interface in Sec. \ref{subsec-time-evol-lat} could be featured by the temporal evolution of $N\!u$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The pure conduction regime ($N\!u \sim (2 \tau)^{-1/2}$) for $\tau  \gtrsim 0$ to $\tau \sim \Ray^{-1/2} =0.02$  (corresponding to Fig.  \ref{fig:melt-field}a).
	Since the temperature gradient has initially huge values because of the sudden increase of the temperature of the left wall, the Nusselt number rapidly decreases during the first stage of the flow evolution. 
	The  signature of this conduction regime is the slow heat transfer characterized by a monotonic decrease of the Nusselt number.
	
	\item The mixed conduction-convection regime  ($ N\!u \sim \tau^{-1/2} + \Ray\, \tau^{3/2}$) for $  0.02  \leq \tau \leq 0.05$ (illustrated in  Fig.  \ref{fig:melt-field}b).

	\item The convection dominated regime ($ N\!u \sim \Ray^{1/4}$) for $\tau > Ra^{-1/2}$  (corresponding to Figs.  \ref{fig:melt-field}c-e).
	The plateau at the value of $\Ray^{1/4}$ corresponds to the pure convective transfer and is observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Nusselt} for $  0.05 \leq \tau \leq 0.1$. Numerical results show a slight decrease of the $N\!u$ in the final stage ($\tau \geq 0.1$), when the melting front starts to touch the right wall of the cavity (see Figs.  \ref{fig:melt-field}e-f). The correlation model is not valid for this late evolution of the melting process.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}


Another important basic quantity describing the melting process is the liquid fraction $L_f$.  
The time evolution of the liquid fraction (Fig. \ref{fig:Lf}a) displays three regimes during the melting process. $L_f$  initially grows as $\tau^{ 1/2}$, which is a typical law for a conduction-dominated heat transfer. Then, a linear temporal evolution is observed, until the melting front reaches the right wall.
This linear regime corresponds to the quasi-steady state observed in the evolution of the Nusselt number (Fig. \ref{fig:Nusselt}).

Using the asymptotic limits of Eq. \ref{eq-Nu-scale} for $ \tau \to 0$ (pure conduction) and $ \tau \to \infty$ (pure convection),  \cite{jany1988scaling} suggested the following correlation law for the time evolution of the liquid fraction:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-Lf-scale}
L_f(\tau) = \left[\left({\sqrt{2 \tau}} \right)^5 + \left(c_1 \Ray^{1/4}  \tau \right)^{5} \right]^{1/5},
\end{equation}
where $c_1=0.27$ is the same constant as in Eq. \ref{eq-Nu-scale}. 
We compare in Fig. \ref{fig:Lf}b our numerical results with the predictions based on Eq. \ref{eq-Lf-scale} within the validity domain of the analysis, \ie before the melting front reaches the right wall of the cavity. A very good agreement is found with theoretical predictions and also with previously published numerical results \citep{Wang2010}.

\subsection{Influence of the Rayleigh number}

	\caption{PCM melting at $L_f = 0.5$. Illustration of the temperature field, the streamlines, and the melting front for three $\Ray$ numbers: (a) $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$ , (b) $\Ray = 1.62 \cdot 10^6$, (c) $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^6$.
	The $\Prd$ and $\Ste$ numbers are kept constant: $\Prd = 56.2$ and $\Ste = 0.045$.} \label{fig:melt-comp-Ra}
\end{figure}

To investigate the influence of the Rayleigh number on the evolution of the melting process, we performed different simulations by multiplying the initial value of $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$ by a factor of 5 and 10, respectively. The exact values are: $\Ray = 1.62 \cdot 10^6$ and $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^6$. 
First, we increase the height $H$ of the cavity by a factor of $\sqrt[3]{5}$ and $\sqrt[3]{10}$ and consider the same $\delta T$.
Thus the $\Ste$ number is kept constant.
Second, we increase the temperature difference parameter $\delta T$ by keeping $H$ constant.
It corresponds of an increased value of the Stefan number by a factor of $5 $ and $10$:
$\Ste = 0.223$ and $\Ste = 0.45$.

Snapshots of numerical solutions for $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$,  $\Ray = 1.62 \cdot 10^6$ and  $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^6$ at constant $\Ste$ number are given in Fig. \ref{fig:melt-comp-Ra}.
The colours correspond to the temperature distribution, the  black lines correspond to the streamlines and the white lines correspond to the solid-liquid interface.
Panels (a) to (c) denote the dynamic of the convective melting when half of the initial solid PCM ($L_f = 0.5$) have melted.
The top part of the interface moves faster while the bottom one is slowed by the increasing value of $\Ray$.
According to the Stefan interface condition in Eq. \ref{eq:Ste-condition}, at constant $\Ste$ and $\Prd$ numbers, the interface velocity is proportional to $\partial T / \partial n$, which is maximum at the top of the cavity because of the clockwise recirculation of the fluid explaining the observed trends.

Figs \ref{fig:Ra-Nusselt-H} and \ref{fig:Ra-Nusselt-deltaT} show the temporal evolution of the liquid fraction $L_f$ (panel a),  and the average Nusselt number defined at the hot wall (panel b). 
The same heat transfer regimes described previously are observed for each case: conduction, mixed conduction-convection and convection.
We note that results are plotted with respect to physical time $t_{\varphi}$ instead of $\tau$, 
because we compare solutions with different values of $H$, which involves in the definition of the non-dimensional times $t$ and $\tau$, making them not relevant to compare results.

\noindent Fig. \ref{fig:Ra-Nusselt-H}a indicates that increasing the Rayleigh number by keeping $\delta T$ constant induces a slower melting rate.
This is the expected behaviour since the size of the PCM is increased by a factor of 2, and the velocity $\vec u$ is decreasing to satisfy the condition $\Rey = 1$.
We note however a non-monotonic variation of the time necessary to melt a fixed value of fluid.
For instance, to achieve $L_f = 0.5$ (50\% of the volume is melted), an increase of $\Ray$ by a factor of $10$ leads to a growth of the time by a factor of $1.7$.
Nonetheless, when $\Ray$ is  $5$ times larger, the necessary time only increases by a factory of $2$.
This is most likely due to the non-linear intricacies of the problem and requires further investigation.\\
Furthermore, the Nusselt number reported in Fig. \ref{fig:Ra-Nusselt-H}b shows that the higher the Rayleigh number, the higher the Nusselt number.
This is consistent, since the temperature gradient is integrated along a greater heated wall. 

\noindent Fig. \ref{fig:Ra-Nusselt-deltaT}a shows that by increasing the value of $\delta T$, and consequently increasing the Rayleigh number and the Stefan number, the PCM melts faster. 
We note that the height $H$ of the cavity is kept constant, hence the natural convection flow in the melted PCM is enhanced when the Rayleigh number keep increasing.
As a consequence, the convection-dominated regime is reached earlier, as shown by the shift of the minimum of the $N\!u$ to lower values of $t_{\varphi}$ in Fig. \ref{fig:Ra-Nusselt-deltaT}b. 
This evolution is also observed for the liquid fraction. 
As expected, an increase of the Rayleigh number and the Stefan number is followed by an enhancement of the heat transfer during the melting, and consequently an improved efficiency of the PCM.

\section{Melting of octadecane PCM with basal melting} \label{sec-melting-basal}

The dynamic of the lateral convection melting was investigated in Sec. \ref{chap-MELTING}
%The melting of PCM heated from the side was presented in Sec. \ref{chap-MELTING}.
%The dynamic of the melting, the identification of three regimes describing the melting process and the effect of the Rayleigh number have been discussed in detail.
We now pay further attention to basal melting of PCM in the current section.
A description of melting process is presented first, then thorough analysis of the heat transfer through a scale analysis is performed.

While the melting of PCM heated from the side have attracted many consideration, the melting of PCM heated from below have received less attention.
\cite{diaz1984visualization,hale1980solid} have studied experimentally the solid-liquid interface morphology of PCM during basal heating.
\cite{gong1998flow} studied numerically the flow and heat transfer during the melting of pure n-octadecane in a rectangular cavity heated from below.
Recent numerical simulations investigate different boundary conditions such as
periodic configurations along the horizontal axis \citep{esfahani2018basal,madruga2018dynamic,favier2019rayleigh} or wavy surface in a rectangular cavity heated from below \citep{kousksou2014melting}.

 We investigate in this chapter the melting of a pure octadecane PCM in a square enclosure heated from below.
 The dynamics of the melting is different in the basal heating case compared with the lateral heating.
 It has been observed that for this configuration natural convection develops in the form of Benard cells and
 results in a nonplanar solid-liquid interface. 
\cite{vasil2011dynamic,favier2019rayleigh} have studied the hydrodynamic instabilities at the onset of convection and compared their observation with the classical Rayleigh-Bénard instability mechanism \citep{chandrasekhar2013hydrodynamic}.
\cite{favier2019rayleigh} have focused their attention to the effect of the non-planar topography of the interface to the convection flow.
 On the other hand, \cite{gong1998flow,esfahani2018basal,madruga2018dynamic} mostly focused on global quantities such as the heat flux and the statistical properties of the interface.

The physical parameters considered are the same as presented in Sec. \ref{sec-melting-lateral}, namely
$\Pr = 56.2$ and $\Ste = 0.045$.
Four Rayleigh numbers are carried out: $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$, $1.62 \cdot 10^6$, $3.27 \cdot 10^6$, and $6.54 \cdot 10^6$ to assess the influence of the size of the domain on the dynamic of the natural convection flow.
%as observed by \cite{madruga2018dynamic}.
The PCM is initially solid at a cold dimensionless temperature $\theta_c$ under the temperature of fusion.
The top of the wall is set at an isothermal temperature $\theta = \theta_c$, the vertical walls are adiabatic and the bottom is heated at a dimensionless temperature $\theta = \theta_h$.

\noindent We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations even if 
 \cite{gau1983flow} and  \cite{gong1998flow} have noticed the existence of three-dimensional convection cells during the very first step of the melting process.
These three-dimensional convection cells are however usually neglected for relatively moderate $\Ray$ numbers, mainly $\Ray \leq 10^8$. 
In such case actually, three-dimensional cells exist in a very short duration compared with the whole melting step,
so that the two-dimensional model is realistic.
A qualitative observation of the dynamic of the natural convection flow and its impact on the melting front is first addressed.
Second, the observation of four regimes during the melting is discussed.
%Finally, a comparison between the lateral and the basal heating is given.

\subsection{Time evolution of the melting process} \label{sec-RB-melt-process}
%
%The natural convection flow in the melt PCM during lateral heating exhibits one convection cell deforming the solid-liquid interface (see Fig. \ref{fig:melt-field}).
%The dynamic of the natural convection flow during the basal heating is different,
%since it is known that any non-planar topography can lead to a baroclinic flow at any Rayleigh number.

Fig. \ref{fig:melt-below} displays the structure of the natural convection in the melting PCM through a sequence of panels for temperature isolines and streamlines in the liquid phase, for $\Ray$ ranging from $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$ to $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^6$.
An array of lengthening plumes (panel a to c) and counter-rotating convective cells (panel d to f)  are located in the liquid phase.
The number of convective cells and plumes increases with the Rayleigh number.
For $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$, three equidistant plumes (Fig. \ref{fig:melt-below}a) and five convective cells (Fig. \ref{fig:melt-below}d) can be observed, while four and six plumes are observed for $\Ray = 1.62 \cdot 10^6$ and $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^6$ respectively (Figs. \ref{fig:melt-below}b and \ref{fig:melt-below}c).
These observations agree well with the numerical results of \cite{gong1998flow} and \cite{madruga2018dynamic}.

\noindent The shape of the interface is directly linked to the dynamic of these plumes.
The mushroom form of the plumes results from the two symmetric counter-rotating convective cells surrounding each plumes.
We observe an anti-clockwise recirculation of the left convection cell and a clockwise recirculation of the right.
Thus, the melt is heated to the highest temperature at bottom and then floats up, reaches the phase change interface and splits into opposite directions.
The melt is cooled as it flows through the phase change interface.
It results a non-planar interface with a peak at the center of each couple of counter-rotating convective cells.

	\label{fig:melt-below}
\end{figure}

It is useful to introduce the effective Rayleigh and Nusselt numbers of the fluid layer, based on the height of the melting PCM, to describe the temporal evolution of the melting:

\begin{eqnarray}
	Ra_{e} &=& Ra \times \bar {\delta_H}^3, \\
	N\!u_{e} &=& N\!u \times \bar{\delta_H},
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent with $\bar{\delta_H}$ the averaged fluid height. Note that $\bar{\delta_H}$ here can be assimilated to the liquid fraction.
In the limit of vanishing $\Ste$ number, the classical no-slip Rayleigh-Bénard convection predicts a critical Rayleigh number $\Ray_c \approx 1707.76 $ \citep{chandrasekhar2013hydrodynamic} after which the first instability appears and the melting front becomes non-planar.\\
Higher is this critical value for increasing $\Ste$ numbers.
In our simulations, the convective onset occurs at around $\Ray_e \approx 5 \times 10^3$, which is in good agreement with the observation of \cite{esfahani2018basal,favier2019rayleigh}.

	\caption{Melting of PCM heated from below for $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$. Time evolution of the temperature field, the streamlines and melting fronts corresponding to $6$ effective $\Ray$ numbers:

	\label{fig:T-evol-Ra-3.27e5}
\end{figure}

The time evolution of the melting for $\Ray = 3.27 \times 10^5$ is illustrated in details through panels (a) to (f) of Fig. \ref{fig:T-evol-Ra-3.27e5}.
Before the first instability arises, the melt layer evolves solely by conduction. 
There is no noticeable fluid flow and the melting front remains straight (panel a).
The convective onset occurs at $\Ray_e \approx 5 \times 10^3$ and the phase-change interface becomes non-planar (panel b).
The appearance of convection is marked by a change in the shape of the interface from straight to nearly periodic curve.\\
While the fluid depth increases, the effective Rayleigh number increases and the convective rolls are stretched vertically (panels b and c).
We note that during this stage, the number of rolls is time-independent.
This stage can be compared to the steady convection after the onset in the Rayleigh-Bénard system (see \cite{chandrasekhar2013hydrodynamic}).

\noindent After the rolls are elongated vertically, they start to oscillate laterally and then merge to create greater rolls (panels d and e).
The essential consequence of the foregoing observation is that the melting front is modified.
The interface is actually shaped by the new flow pattern. 
%Two peaks are observed but are still periodic at the interface related to the four convective rolls.
Finally, after the roll merging and the oscillating behavior observed in panels (d) and (e), 
the foregoing steady convection observation is then reached again in panel (f).

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:T-evol-Ra-6.54e6} shows the dynamic of the melting for higher $\Ray$ number.
The size of the cavity is increased of an order of $3$, corresponding to $\Ray = 6.54 \cdot 10^6$ while the $\Ste$ number remains the same.
The stages described previously are recovered in panels (a) to (e), mainly the onset of the natural convection at $\Ray = 4.8 \cdot 10^3$ followed by an oscillating regime accompanied by a roll merging process.
At $\Ray_e = 4 \times 10^5$ (panel g) the interface loses periodicity and the structure of the rolls becomes disordered.



\subsection{Scale analysis} \label{sec-RB-scal-analysis}
We conduct in this section a more quantitative analysis by evaluating the heat transfer rate during the melting.
The same analysis used for the melting with lateral heating is used to study the heat transfer when basal heating is of interest.

The dynamic of the melting in the framework of PCM heated from below could be classified into five regimes: a conductive regime, a linear regime, an oscillating regime, a turbulent regime, and finally an ultimate regime.
We note that the simulations investigated in the present work rely only on the first three regimes.
During the convective regime, the heat transfer is fully dominated by the conduction. 
The time evolution of the liquid fraction and the Nusselt number could be approximated by the same scaling obtained in Eq. \ref{eq-Nu-Lf-Corr-Lat}.
However, after the onset of the convection, the quasi-steady state assumption of the heat transfer during lateral melting is no longer valid due to the instabilities.

When the convective heat transfer is fully developed in the melted PCM, two regimes could be identified.
First, a bulk heat transfer regime occurs for low effective Rayleigh number regime, mainly for $\Ray_{e} \leq 10^5$.
Then, a boundary layer heat transfer regime is predominant when oscillating or turbulent regimes are achieved.
We develop in this section a scale analysis during the bulk heat transfer regime to approximate the amount of heat transfer.
Beyond this regime, due to the important non-linearities of the dynamics, we rely on theories developed in the frame of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection flow  \citep{malkus1954heat,grossmann2000scaling}. %made in the frame of Rayleigh-Bénard convection flow

During the bulk heat transfer regime, the convective cells are stretched vertically and the number of rolls is time-independent.
A schematic overview of the phenomenon is drawn in Fig. \ref{fig:roll-basal-heating}. 
Let $L_r$ define the half-thickness of a cell. %as it is shown in Fig. (\ref{fig:roll-basal-heating}). 
A good scaling during this regime is hence: 
\begin{equation}
	x \sim L_{r}, \quad y \sim \bar \delta_H,
\end{equation}
with $L_{r} \ll \bar \delta_H$.
Since the quasi steady-state assumption is no longer valid, we turn back to the full incompressible Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations:

\begin{figure}

\caption{Natural convection flow for melting heated from below.}
\label{fig:roll-basal-heating}
\end{figure}

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-mass-basal}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &=& 0, \\  \label{eq-mom-basal-x}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} &=& - \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right), \\ \label{eq-mom-basal-y}
	\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &=& - \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} +  \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right) + g \beta (T - T_{ref}), \\ \label{eq-bound-energy}
	\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} &=& \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} \right). 	
\end{eqnarray}
We first eliminate the pressure $p$ between the two momentum Eqs. \ref{eq-mom-basal-x} and \ref{eq-mom-basal-y}.
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-mom-rassembly}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(  \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right)  \\ \nonumber
	= \nu \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right)   - \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right) \right] - \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} g \beta.
\end{eqnarray}
Since we have $L_{r} \ll \delta_h$ (consequently $\partial^2 v/\partial y^2 \ll \partial^2 v/\partial x^2 $),
three terms dominate the Eq. \ref{eq-mom-rassembly}:
\begin{equation}
	\underbrace{\frac{\partial ^2 v}{\partial x \partial t}}_{inertia} \quad \underbrace{\nu \frac{\partial^3v}{\partial x^3}}_{friction} \quad \underbrace{g \beta \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}}_{buoyancy}.
\end{equation}
In terms of representative scales, this momentum balance reads
\begin{equation} \label{eq-basal-heat-mom}
	\underbrace{\frac{v}{L_{r} t}}_{inertia} \quad \underbrace{\nu \frac{v}{L_{r}^3}}_{friction} \quad \underbrace{g \beta \frac{\Delta T}{L_{r}}}_{buoyancy},
\end{equation}
The regime of interest occurs after a pure conductive regime where the boundary layer thickness increases as
\begin{equation}
	\delta_{\theta} \sim (\alpha t)^{1/2},
\end{equation}
with $\delta_T$ the thickness of the boundary layer. 
Since the heat transfer is dominated solely by bulk heat transfer we have:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-Lf-deltT}
 	L_{r} \sim \delta_T.
 \end{equation}
Eq. \ref{eq-basal-heat-mom} could be hence simplified by replacing $\delta_T^2 \sim (\alpha t)$ and dividing Eq. \ref{eq-basal-heat-mom} through the friction scale, leading to
\begin{equation}
	\underbrace{\frac{1}{\Pr}}_{inertia} \quad \underbrace{1}_{friction}  \quad \underbrace{\frac{g \beta \Delta T \delta_T^2}{v \nu}}_{buoyancy}.
\end{equation}
For high-Prandtl fluid, the momentum balance is between buoyancy and friction and we obtain
\begin{equation}
	v \sim \frac{g \beta \Delta T \alpha t}{\nu}
\end{equation}

Next, we turn attention back to the energy Eq. \ref{eq-bound-energy}.
Three distinct effects could be identified:
\begin{equation}
	\underbrace{\frac{\Delta T}{t}}_{Inertia} \quad \underbrace{v \frac{\Delta T}{\bar \delta_h}}_{Convection} \quad \underbrace{\alpha \frac{\Delta T}{L_r^2}}_{Conduction}.
\end{equation}
When $t$ increases, there comes an effective time $t_{e}$ where the inertia decreases in importance and the energy equation expresses a balance between the convection and the conduction heat transfer,
%Again, if the assumption $L_r \sim \delta_T$ holds, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
	v \frac{\Delta T}{\bar \delta_H} \sim \alpha \frac{\Delta T}{\delta_T^2},
\end{equation}
leading to
\begin{equation}
	t_{e} \sim \left( \frac{\nu \bar \delta_H}{g \beta \Delta T \alpha} \right)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
At such a time, the thermal layer thickness is:
\begin{equation}
	\delta_{\theta} \sim (\alpha t_{e})^{1/2} \sim \bar \delta_H \Ray_{e}^{-1/4} \sim \left( \bar \delta_H H^3 \right)^{1/4} \Ray^{-1/4}.
\end{equation}
Accordingly, for $\Ray \leq 10^5$, the scaling for $N\!u$ is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq-Nu-scal-basal}
	N\!u \sim \left( \frac{H}{\bar \delta_H}\right)^{1/4} \Ray^{1/4}.
\end{equation}
One can note that when $\bar \delta_H = H$, we recover the scaling for lateral heating.

\noindent Fig. \ref{fig:NU-LF-evol}a plots the temporal evolution of the heat flux, represented by the Nusselt number, and the strength of buoyancy, represented by the Rayleigh number, when the melting evolves.

\noindent The onset of the convection arises at $\Ray_e = 3 \times 10^3$, when a sudden jump in $N\!u_e$ is observed.
\cite{vasil2011dynamic} have investigated a weakly non-linear stability analysis and have highlighted a superexponentional amplitude growth when the Rayleigh number becomes close to the traditional critical value in the limit of vanishing Stefan number.
This superexponential growth is moreover followed by a rapid pattern readjustment.
The trend of $N\!u_e$ at the onset of convection is in total accordance with this prediction of \cite{vasil2011dynamic}.
The results of \citep{esfahani2018basal,madruga2018dynamic,favier2019rayleigh} exhibit the same trend despite the different boundary conditions (periodic lateral boundary conditions, adiabatic boundary conditions at the top of the cavity, and low value of $\Prd$ for \cite{esfahani2018basal} and \cite{favier2019rayleigh}).

\noindent The rapid growth of $N\!u_e$ is followed by a power law with averaged exponent $N\!u \sim \Ray^{0.28}$ for  $10^3 \leq \Ray \leq  10^5$.
Our results overestimate slightly the predicted scaling exponent presented in Eq. \ref{eq-Nu-scal-basal}.
This is mostly due to the number of convection cells in the melted PCM, which increases with the $\Ray$ numbers, and the effect of the non-planar solid-liquid interface, not taken into account in our analysis.
However, our numerical results match better with the Grossmann-Lohse theory \citep{grossmann2000scaling}, which predicts a scaling exponent of $2/7$, within the framework of natural convection low.

\noindent Finally, the transition from steady pattern of the convective rolls to oscillating patterns followed by cell merging, as it is clearly shown in Fig. \ref{fig:T-evol-Ra-6.54e6}(d-f), 
is also illustrated by a decrease of $N\!u$ at $\Ray \sim 10^5$ followed by high oscillation in the temporal evolution of the heat transfer.
The power-law relation $N\!u-\Ray$ is bounded in this stage by the average exponent of $1/3$.

As far as the time evolution of the liquid fraction $L_f$ is concerned, one can introduce the following scaling, from the \cite{grossmann2000scaling} theory (see also \cite{favier2019rayleigh}):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:scal-Lf-RB}
	L_f(t) = \left[ \sqrt{2 \tau}^{(2-3 \beta)}+ c \Ray^\beta \tau \right]^{1/(2-3 \beta)},
\end{equation}
with $\beta$ the exponent in the $N\!u-\Ray$ power law, $c = \frac{(2-3 \beta) \gamma}{2 + \Ste}$ and $\gamma$ a constant fitted from numerical data.

The time evolution of the liquid fraction is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:NU-LF-evol}b.
As expected, the purely diffusive stage displays the scaling $L_f \sim t^{1/2}$.
By replacing $\beta$ by the exponent value $2/7$ in Eq. \ref{eq:scal-Lf-RB}, we obtain $L_f \sim t^{7/8}$.
Our simulations exhibit a power-law evolution of $L_f \sim t^{0.82}$ when the convection is fully developed in the fluid, corresponding to $\Ray_e \geq \Ray_c$.

\section{Comparison between lateral and basal heating}
We now compare the temporal evolution of some physical quantities for both cases.
The liquid fraction $L_f$, the Nusselt number $N\!u$, and the accumulated heat input $Q_0$ are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:NU-LF-Q0-compare}, for $3$ values of the $\Ray$ numbers: $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$ (left), $\Ray = 1.62 \cdot 10^6$ (middle), and $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^6$ (right).
Blue lines denote the lateral heating case and red lines the basal heating.

For $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^5$ (panel a), $L_f$, $N\!u$, and $Q_0$ evolves with the same trends.
From $t=0$ to $t=18$, both curves matches perfectly well during the conductive regime. 
The formation of the convection for the basal heating case, is characterized by a slight decrease of the three curves at $t=20$, followed by a reconnection of the curves.
As predicted by Eq. \ref{eq-Nu-scal-basal}, as the fluid depth increases when the melting evolves, $N\!u$ decreases up to reaching the lateral heating curve.

Significant differences arise when $\Ray_e \geq 5 \cdot 10^5$, corresponding to greater cavity sizes, with $\Ray = 1.62 \cdot 10^6$, and $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^6$.
From $t=40$ for $\Ray = 1.62 \cdot 10^6$, and $t=30$ for $\Ray = 3.27 \cdot 10^6$, noticeable differences are apparent in the time evolution of the Nusselt number.
The blue curves (lateral heating) exhibit a smooth and a quasi-steady evolution of $N\!u$, while high oscillating value of $N\!u$ is observed for the red curves (basal heating).
This occurs when the heat transfer is no longer bulk heat transfer for the BM case.
We note that, at this stage, the decrease of the number of convection cells is accompanied by a decrease of the heat transfer.
Consequently, the accumulated heat input $Q_0$ is higher for the LM case from the oscillating regime.

%\noindent This decrease of the amount of the accumulated heat input, for BM case, during the oscillating regime, could be explained by the rule of the bulk heat transfer at this stage.
%When the boundary layer heat transfer is predominant, Eq. \ref{eq-Lf-deltT} is indeed no more valid, and the contribution of
